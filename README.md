### Homework
Our *Lucky Five* program will require that certain **data be stored on a semi-permanent basis**; namely, past winning ticket numbers.  Learning about data storage is one of our goals, so let's start there.

For a small program, like *Lucky Five*, Python's `pickle` module is a great way to get started with data storage. The `pickle` module allows you to easily **"serialize"** your data/objects to a file not only for posterity but also for **later use and recall**. To this day, file-based storage strategies like this are common and serve as a "gateway drug" of sorts to other more sophisticated strategies, e.g., relational databases, APIs, object databases, etc.

Another goal is to understand and be able to leverage **Object-Oriented Programming** techniques. This is important because **everything in Python is an object** and because OOP-techniques are requisite in using `Tkinter` and countless other language extensions and modules. Ultimately, we will be implementing *Lucky Five* using classes, e.g., `Ticket`, `LuckyFive`, `LuckyFiveGUI`, etc.

* **Explore the `pickle` module referring to *Python for Kids***, Chapter 10, Using the pickle Module to Save Information

  See if you can pickle stuff and then get it "out of the jar" again
  
  Take a gander at the official documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" target="_blank">pickle â€” Python object serialization</a>
  
* **Read Up on Object-Oriented Programming**
  
  Take some time to review the following:
